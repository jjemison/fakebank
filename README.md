Step 1 & 2

Problem: Donâ€™t know what FakeBank is when you first visit the homepage.

Solution: Create a call to action guide the user to start application process. Additionally, allow FakeBank to capture the customers contact info to continue to selling them on the using FakeBank through email or call.   

Problem: Redundancies with about and contact pages
Solution: Remove independent pages for contact and about and instead integrate them on the homepage 

Problem: Text under icons have underline
Solution: Users associate text with an underline as clickable link, to eliminate confusion I removed  the underline under text 

Problem: About us is at the bottom of the homepage
Solution:  Moved about us under hero, always good to introduce the user to who you at the beginning to build trust

Problem: No section title under the section with icons
Solution: Added title to let users know why they should use FakeBank 

Problem: Weak Testimonial from John Smith
Solution: Added a stronger testimonial, added why he is thanking FakeBank. Additionally, gave testimonials their own section to make it appear there is more info on the page

Problem: Submit button under Pre-Approved form same color as background
Solution: Have a clear submit button that is a different color than the background
